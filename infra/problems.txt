- api gateway creation, dependency issue
- certificate creation, CNAME creation -> validation
- need domain cert for root also

-- To use a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to require HTTPS between viewers and CloudFront, make sure you request (or import) the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1).
- Cognito Alias for Custom Domain

Due to CDKTF's inability to programmatically retrieve the CloudFront distribution associated with the Cognito User Pool Domain, you must manually create the Route53 alias A record after deploying your stack.
Retrieve the CloudFront Distribution Domain Name:

    Navigate to the Amazon Cognito console.
    Select your User Pool.
    Go to the "Domain name" section.
    Locate and note the CloudFront distribution domain name associated with auth.not-a-wise.click.

Create the Route53 Alias Record:

    Navigate to the Route53 console.
    Select the hosted zone for not-a-wise.click.
    Create a new "A - IPv4 address" record:
        Name: auth.not-a-wise.click
        Type: A
        Alias: Yes
        Alias Target: Enter the CloudFront distribution domain name obtained earlier.
        Routing Policy: Simple
        Evaluate Target Health: No
    Save the record.
